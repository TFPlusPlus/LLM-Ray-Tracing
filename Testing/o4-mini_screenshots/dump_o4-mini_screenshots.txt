The ray is inside the cube if and only if the intersection of those three intervals (one per axis) is non\u2010empty.  Tracking the maximum of the nears and the minimum of the fars gives you the final interval of intersection.\n\n3.  **Handling parallel rays**  \n    If the ray is parallel to an axis (`direction` component is zero), you check if the origin\u2019s coordinate is between the slabs.  If it\u2019s outside, no intersection; if it\u2019s inside, that axis imposes no constraint.\n\n4.  **Picking the first hit**  \n    Since the ray starts outside, the entry point is `t_min` (assuming `t_min \u2265 0`).  If the origin somehow lies inside the cube, then `t_min` will be negative and the first visible intersection is actually when the ray exits the cube at `t_max`.\n\nThis runs in O(1) time, is numerically stable (handles zero\u2010direction cases), and correctly treats grazing (tangent) rays as intersections.",
        "One of the standard and most efficient ways to do this is the \u201cslab\u2010method\u201d ray\u2010box test.  The idea is:\n\n  1.  For each coordinate\u2010axis (x, y, z) you look at the two \u201cplanes\u201d of the cube perpendicular to that axis (e.g. x=0 and x=1 for the x\u2010slab),\n  2.  Compute the values of t at which the ray intersects those two planes,\n  3.  Keep track of the largest of the \u201centry\u201d t\u2019s (call it t_near) and the smallest of the \u201cexit\u201d t\u2019s (call it t_far),\n  4.  If at the end t_near \u2264 t_far and t_far \u2265 0 you have an intersection; the first intersection along the ray is at t = t_near (provided t_near \u2265 0; if t_near < 0 but t_far \u2265 0 it means the ray origin is inside the cube and the first exit is at t_far).\n\nHere\u2019s a clean Python implementation.

        "Here is a very direct way to think about it:\n\n1.  Compute the intersection of your ray  \n      R(t)=O + t D  \n    with the plane of the trapezoid.

A normal to that plane is  \n      n = (\u22121,0,1).  \n\n2.  If D\u00b7n is zero (or nearly zero) your ray is parallel to the quad \u2192 no intersection.  \n    Otherwise  \n      t = \u2212(O\u00b7n)/(D\u00b7n)  \n    (because the plane passes through the origin, its D term is 0).  If t<0 \u2192 the intersection is \u201cbehind\u201d the ray origin \u2192 return \u22121.\n\n3.  Form the candidate intersection point  \n      P = O + t D.  \n\n4.  Test whether P lies inside the convex quadrilateral V\u2080V\u2081V\u2082V\u2083.  A perfectly general way is to do four \u201cedge tests.\u201d  For each edge E\u1d62 = V_{i+1} \u2212 V\u1d62, form the vector from V\u1d62 to P, call it W\u1d62 = P \u2212 V\u1d62, and compute the cross\u2010product C\u1d62 = E\u1d62 \u00d7 W\u1d62.

We pick three of the quad\u2019s vertices (A, B, Dpt) to form two edge\u2010vectors e1 and e2 and take their cross\u2010product to get the plane normal n.  \n2.  Solve for t in dot((A \u2212 O), n) = t\u00b7dot(D, n).  If the denominator is near zero, the ray is parallel.  If t\u22640, the hit is behind the ray origin.  \n3.  Compute the hit point P = O + t D.  \n4.  For each of the 4 edges (Vi\u2192Vj), check that P lies on the left side of the edge (when the quad is seen along n).  Equivalently, for each edge compute cross(Vj\u2212Vi, P\u2212Vi)\u00b7n; if any of these is negative, P is outside the quad.  \n5.  Finally, reject P if it lies strictly inside the circular hole of radius 1.  We compare the squared distance of P to the origin with 1\u00b2; points exactly on the circle boundary (dist\u00b2\u22481) are considered \u201cgrazing\u201d and thus count as valid hits.  \n\nThis runs in constant time per ray and correctly handles grazing, back\u2010facing, parallel, hole, and boundary conditions.",
        "Here is a self-contained Python implementation of the ray-quad-with-hole intersection test.  It does the following steps:\n\n1.

Rejects t \u2264 0 (only forward intersections).  \n4. Computes P = O + t D.  \n5. Tests whether P lies inside the convex quad ABCD by splitting it into two triangles (A,B,C) and (A,C,D) and doing a standard \u201csame\u2010side\u201d test in each.  \n6.

Geometrically, the solid object is the part of \\[t0,t1\\] that does *not* lie in \\[s0,s1\\].  Subtracting one interval from the other yields up to two disjoint sub\u2010intervals.

For each non\u2010negative root we check whether the y\u2013z radius at that point  \n       \u221a(y\u00b2+z\u00b2) \u2265 0.7  \n    (i.e. it isn\u2019t inside the drilled cylinder).  If it passes, we record that t.\n\n2.  **Cylinder**:  \n    We solve for the infinite cylinder around the x\u2010axis:  \n       (Oy + t Dy)\u00b2 + (Oz + t Dz)\u00b2 = 0.7\u00b2  \n    giving roots tc0, tc1.  For each non\u2010negative root we check that the hit point also lies within the sphere  \n       x\u00b2+y\u00b2+z\u00b2 \u2264 1  \n    (i.e. it\u2019s actually on the inner wall of the spherical shell).  If it passes, we record that t.\n\n3.  We return the smallest recorded t, or \u20131 if none survived both tests.\n\nThis correctly handles rays that:\n- hit the outer sphere,\n- miss the hole,\n- go through the hole and strike the inner cylindrical wall,\n- or even just graze either surface.",
        "Here is a recipe for intersecting a ray  \nR(t)=O+t\u2009D  \nwith the \u201csphere with a cylindrical hole\u201d (sphere radius 1 centered at the origin, minus the intersection with the infinite cylinder of radius 0.7 about the x\u2013axis).  \n\n1.  Solve for t the sphere\u2010intersection quadratic  \n    \n    \u2003\u2003\u2006|O+t\u2009D|\u00b2=1\u00b2  \n    \u21d2 (D\u00b7D)\u2009t\u00b2 + 2\u2009(O\u00b7D)\u2009t + (O\u00b7O\u20131)=0.  \n      \n    If the discriminant<0 there is no intersection with the outer sphere \u21d2 return \u20131.  \n    Otherwise let t\u2081\u2264t\u2082 be the two roots.  \n\n2.  Walk through t\u2081 and t\u2082 in ascending order, keeping only those t>0.  For each such t compute P=O+t\u2009D.  \n    Check whether that P lies in the *kept* part of the sphere\u2014that is, whether it lies *outside* the cylinder:  \n      \n       P_y\u00b2+P_z\u00b2 > (0.7)\u00b2  ?  \n      \n    If yes, that P is on the *outer* sphere and not in the hole \u21d2 that is your hit \u21d2 return t.  \n\n3.  If neither t\u2081 nor t\u2082 gave you a sphere\u2010hit (they were either negative or landed in the removed hole), you still might hit the *inner* cylindrical surface.  Solve the cylinder\u2010side quadratic for  \n      \n       (O_y+t\u2009D_y)\u00b2 + (O_z+t\u2009D_z)\u00b2 = (0.7)\u00b2  \n      \n    i.e.  \n      \n       a = D_y\u00b2 + D_z\u00b2  \n       b = 2\u2009(O_y\u2009D_y + O_z\u2009D_z)  \n       c = O_y\u00b2 + O_z\u00b2 \u2013 0.7\u00b2  \n      \n    \u2022  If a\u22480 then the ray is parallel to the cylinder axis.  If c>0 you are entirely outside the cylinder so no side\u2010hits; if c<0 you are inside the cylinder all along so again no new intersection.  If c\u22480 you start exactly on the cylinder surface but then you never cross it\u2014no new hits.  \n    \u2022  Otherwise form the discriminant \u0394 = b\u00b2\u20134ac.  If \u0394<0 no side\u2010hits.  If \u0394\u22650 let the two roots (or one double\u2010root) be t\u2032\u2081\u2264t\u2032\u2082.  \n\n    Now for each of t\u2032\u2081,t\u2032\u2082 in ascending order, keep only those t\u2032>0, compute P=O+t\u2032\u2009D, and check that |P|\u00b2\u22641+\u03b5 (i.e. it lies inside the sphere or exactly on it).  Those t\u2032 are genuine hits on the *inner* cylinder boundary (the walls of the hole).  Pick the smallest positive one, if any, and return it.  \n\n4.  If you have exhausted both the sphere\u2010roots (step 2) and the cylinder\u2010roots (step 3) without finding a valid positive t, return \u20131.  \n\nThat algorithm will return the distance to the first point at which the ray actually meets the remaining solid (\u201couter\u201d sphere surface where not drilled out, or \u201cinner\u201d cylinder wall where that is the first boundary you see).  \n\n\u2014  \n\nBelow is a clean Python implementation.

Any root t that lands *outside* the drill\u2010hole\n   (i.e. y\u00b2+z\u00b2>0.7\u00b2) is a valid hit on the solid shell.  We return the smallest positive one of those immediately.\n\n\u2022  If both sphere\u2010hits land in the drill\u2010hole region, they aren\u2019t on our object at all (that bit of sphere has\n   been removed), so we skip them.\n\n\u2022  Next we intersect the ray with the **side** of the cylinder (the inner wall of the hole).  Any positive\u2010t\n   hit that also lies inside the sphere (so that the cylinder side really is in our sphere) is a valid\n   intersection with the hole\u2019s wall.  We return the nearest such t.\n\n\u2022  If neither gave a valid positive t, the ray misses the remaining solid and we return \u20131.\n\nThis handles tangents (discriminant\u22480), rays parallel to the cylinder axis (a\u22480), rays that go cleanly\nthrough the hole without ever striking the shell, etc.",

If there is no intersection it returns -1.  \n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef intersect_sphere_with_hole(O, D,\n                              sphere_radius = 1.0,\n                              cyl_radius   = 0.7):\n    \"\"\"\n    O, D : tuple or list of 3 floats  -- ray origin and (normalized) direction\n    sphere_radius : float             -- radius of the outer sphere\n    cyl_radius    : float             -- radius of the removed cylinder (about x-axis)\n    \n    Returns the smallest t>0 so that O + t D lies on the boundary of\n      (Sphere of radius sphere_radius) MINUS (infinite cylinder about x with radius cyl_radius),\n    or -1 if no such t exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    Ox, Oy, Oz = O\n    Dx, Dy, Dz = D\n    \n    # ---- 1) Solve sphere intersection: |O + t D|^2 = sphere_radius^2\n    #    a t^2 + b t + c = 0\n    a = Dx*Dx + Dy*Dy + Dz*Dz\n    b = 2*(Ox*Dx + Oy*Dy + Oz*Dz)\n    c = Ox*Ox + Oy*Oy + Oz*Oz - sphere_radius*sphere_radius\n    \n    disc_s = b*b - 4*a*c\n    if disc_s < 0:\n        return -1.0     # no real intersection with sphere at all\n    \n    # we allow grazing => disc_s == 0 is fine\n    sqrt_disc_s = math.sqrt(max(0.0, disc_s))\n    t_s1 = (-b - sqrt_disc_s)/(2*a)\n    t_s2 = (-b + sqrt_disc_s)/(2*a)\n    # we want the smaller positive root first\n    ts = []\n    if t_s1 > 1e-8: ts.append(t_s1)\n    if t_s2 > 1e-8: ts.append(t_s2)\n    \n    # ---- 2) Solve cylinder intersection: (Oy + t Dy)^2 + (Oz + t Dz)^2 = cyl_radius^2\n    A = Dy*Dy + Dz*Dz\n    B = 2*(Oy*Dy + Oz*Dz)\n    C = Oy*Oy + Oz*Oz - cyl_radius*cyl_radius\n    \n    tc = []\n    if abs(A) > 1e-12:\n        disc_c = B*B - 4*A*C\n        if disc_c >= 0:\n            sqrt_disc_c = math.sqrt(max(0.0, disc_c))\n            t_c1 = (-B - sqrt_disc_c)/(2*A)\n            t_c2 = (-B + sqrt_disc_c)/(2*A)\n            if t_c1 > 1e-8: tc.append(t_c1)\n            if t_c2 > 1e-8: tc.append(t_c2)\n    else:\n        # Ray parallel to the cylinder axis (x-axis).\n        # Then either never intersects (if Oy^2+Oz^2 != r^2)\n        # or grazes everywhere (infinitely many), but grazing we treat as no boundary.\n        tc = []\n    \n    # ---- 3) Collect all candidate hits:\n    #   (a) sphere\u2010surface hits that lie *outside* the cylinder (i.e. hole region removed)\n    #   (b) cylinder\u2010surface hits that lie *inside* the sphere\n    candidates = []\n    \n    # (a) sphere hits\n    for t in ts:\n        x = Ox + t*Dx\n        y = Oy + t*Dy\n        z = Oz + t*Dz\n        # only if outside the cylinder\n        if (y*y + z*z) >= cyl_radius*cyl_radius:\n            candidates.append(t)\n    \n    # (b) cylinder hits\n    for t in tc:\n        x = Ox + t*Dx\n        y = Oy + t*Dy\n        z = Oz + t*Dz\n        # only if inside the sphere\n        if (x*x + y*y + z*z) <= sphere_radius*sphere_radius:\n            candidates.append(t)\n    \n    if not candidates:\n        return -1.0\n    \n    return min(candidates)\n\n\n# ------ quick smoke test ------\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Ray straight at the center of the sphere along -z, starts at z=+5\n    O = (0.0, 0.0, 5.0)\n    D = (0.0, 0.0,-1.0)\n    print(intersect_sphere_with_hole(O,D))   # should hit the sphere at t=4.0 (z=1)\n\n    # Now nudge into the hole: start slightly off-center so that y^2+z^2<0.7^2\n    O = (0.0, 0.5, 5.0)\n    D = (0.0, 0.0,-1.0)\n    print(intersect_sphere_with_hole(O,D))\n    # This should return the t where the ray hits the cylinder wall inside the sphere,\n    # i.e. solve y^2+z^2=0.7^2: 0.5^2 + (5-t)^2 = 0.7^2  => (5-t)^2 = 0.49-0.25=0.24  => t\u22485\u00b1\u221a0.24\n    # the smaller positive \u22485 - 0.4899 = 4.5101\n\n```\n\nExplanation of the steps:\n\n1. **Sphere intersection**  \n   Solve  \n   \u2003\u2003\u2016O + tD\u2016\u00b2 = R\u00b2  \u21d2  `a t\u00b2 + b t + c = 0`  \n   with  \n     a = D\u00b7D  \n     b = 2 (O\u00b7D)  \n     c = O\u00b7O \u2013 R\u00b2.  \n   If the discriminant < 0, the ray misses the sphere altogether \u2192 return -1.\n\n2. **Cylinder intersection**  \n   The infinite cylinder about the x\u2013axis of radius \u03c1 satisfies  \n   \u2003\u2003(Oy + t Dy)\u00b2 + (Oz + t Dz)\u00b2 = \u03c1\u00b2.  \n   We solve that quadratic in exactly the same way.  If the ray is exactly parallel to the cylinder axis (i.e. Dy= Dz= 0), then it either never \u201cpierces\u201d the cylindrical wall or it grazes it everywhere \u2013 in practice that contributes no meaningful new boundary hits.\n\n3. **Select only the portions of those two surfaces which actually bound our object**  \n   \u2013 A point on the *sphere* is part of the object\u2019s outer boundary only if it lies *outside* the cylinder (so that that bit of sphere wasn\u2019t carved away).  \n   \u2013 A point on the *cylinder* is part of the boundary only if it also lies *inside* the sphere (so it really is cutting a hole in the sphere).  \n\n4.

This will give you exactly the pictures you showed in your tests."
