Both `origin` and `direction` are represented as arrays: [x, y, z].\n- `sphere1` and `sphere2` are objects with properties `center` (a 3D point indicating the center of the sphere) and `radius` (the radius of the sphere). `center` is represented as an array: [x, y, z].\n\nThe function should return an object with two properties: `sphere` and `point`.\n- `sphere` is either 1 or 2, indicating which sphere the ray intersects first. If the ray does not intersect any sphere, the `sphere` property should be `null`.\n- `point` is an array [x, y, z] representing the 3D point of intersection. If the ray does not intersect any sphere, the `point` property should be `null`.\n\nAssume that the ray, the spheres, and the space they occupy are all ideal mathematical constructs with no measurement errors. The ray is a straight line that can extend infinitely in its direction, and the spheres are perfectly round.\n\nYou can use the well-known quadratic formula to find the roots of the intersection equation. Any roots that are less than 0 should be disregarded as they lie \"behind\" the ray. If you find two roots, the smaller one indicates the first intersection point.\n\nHere is an example of how your function might be called:\n\n```javascript\nlet ray = {\n  origin: [0, 0, 0],\n  direction: [1, 0, 0]\n};\n\nlet sphere1 = {\n  center: [5, 0, 0],\n  radius: 1\n};\n\nlet sphere2 = {\n  center: [10, 0, 0],\n  radius: 2\n};\n\nconsole.log(findIntersection(ray, sphere1, sphere2));\n// Output: { sphere: 1, point: [4, 0, 0] }\n```\n\nIn this example, the ray starts at the origin and extends along the positive x-axis. It intersects sphere1 at the point [4, 0, 0] before it intersects sphere2. So, the function returns `{ sphere: 1, point: [4, 0, 0] }`.",

Two spheres `S1` and `S2` where each sphere is represented by its center `C` and radius `r`. \n\nFor sphere `S1`, `C1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `r1` is the radius.\nFor sphere `S2`, `C2 = (x2, y2, z2)` and `r2` is the radius.\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Write a function `ray_sphere_intersection(O, D, C, r)` that takes in the origin and direction of the ray, and the center and radius of a sphere, and returns the intersection points (if any) between the ray and the sphere. If there are no intersection points, the function should return `None`.\n\n2. Use your function to find the intersection points between the ray `R(t)` and the two spheres `S1` and `S2`.\n\nNote: The intersection of a ray and a sphere is given by solving the quadratic equation `(D . (O - C))^2 - (O - C) . (O - C) + r^2 = 0` where `.` represents the dot product. This equation results from substituting the ray equation into the sphere equation and re-arranging it to the standard quadratic form `at^2 + bt + c = 0`.\n\nYou can represent the vectors and points in this exercise as tuples or lists of three elements. You can assume that the direction vector `D` is normalized (i.e., its length is 1).\n\nYou are allowed to use any programming language for this task. However, please provide clear comments and explanations for your code so that it can be easily understood by others. \n\nRemember to handle both the cases where the ray intersects the sphere at two points, at one point (i.e., the ray is tangent to the sphere), and does not intersect the sphere at all. \n\nPlease submit your solution as a source code file with any necessary instructions for running the code.",

        "Question:\n\nConsider a simple 3D scene consisting of a single Disc object. A Disc in our 3D world is defined by its center `C` (a point in the 3D space), its normal `N` (a unit vector), and its radius `r`. \n\nThe equation of a Disc in our 3D space is given by the equation `(P-C).N=0` for the plane, and `|P-C|^2 <= r^2` for the Disc, where `P` is any point on the Disc. \n\nA ray `R` in the 3D space is defined by its origin `O` and its direction `D` (a unit vector). The equation of a ray in our 3D space is given by `P = O + tD`, where `t >= 0`.\n\nYour task is to implement a method `intersect(Disc disc, Ray ray)` in your favorite programming language, which takes a Disc and a Ray as input, and determines whether the Ray intersects the Disc. If the Ray intersects the Disc, the method should return the value of `t` at the intersection point. If the Ray does not intersect the Disc, the method should return `null` (or an equivalent in your language, such as `None` in Python).\n\nAssumptions:\n- The Disc and the Ray are defined in the same 3D space.\n- The Disc's normal and the Ray's direction are both normalized (i.e., they are unit vectors).\n- The Disc's radius is a positive number.\n- The Ray's `t` parameter is a non-negative real number, with `t=0` representing the Ray's origin.\n\nHint:\n1. First, find the intersection of the Ray with the plane of the Disc. This can be done by solving the equation `(P-C).N=0` for `P=O + tD`, which gives `t = (C-O).N / D.N`. If `D.N = 0`, the Ray is parallel to the plane and there's no intersection.\n2. If an intersection point `P` is found, check if it lies within the Disc by verifying if `|P-C|^2 <= r^2`.\n\nPlease make sure to handle edge cases appropriately, such as when the Ray is parallel to the Disc's plane, or when the intersection point lies on the Disc's boundary.",

The ray is represented by an origin `O` and a direction `D`.\n\nYour task is to write a function `rayPlaneIntersection` in C++ that takes the parameters of the ray and the plane and calculates the intersection point of the ray with the plane. However, if the intersection point lies within the triangle hole, the function should return that no intersection has occurred.\n\nThe function should follow the prototype:\n\n```cpp\nbool rayPlaneIntersection(Point O, Vector D, Point P0, Vector N, Point T1, Point T2, Point T3, Point& I);\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `O` is the origin of the ray.\n- `D` is the direction of the ray.\n- `P0` is a point on the plane.\n- `N` is the normal to the plane.\n- `T1`, `T2`, `T3` are the points that define the triangle hole in the plane.\n- `I` is the intersection point. It should be set by the function if an intersection occurs.\n\nThe function should return `true` if the ray intersects the plane outside the triangle hole and `false` otherwise. In case of intersection, the function should also set the parameter `I` to the intersection point.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- All vectors and points are in 3D.

Dot product measures the angle between two vectors, while cross product results in a vector that's perpendicular to both input vectors, with its direction given by the right-hand rule.",

If no intersection exists, your function should return `None` or an equivalent value in your programming language.\n\nThe mathematical representation of a ray is given by `P = o + td`, where `P` is any point along the ray, `t` is the distance from the origin to point `P`, and `d` is the direction vector of the ray. \n\nThe mathematical representation of an ellipsoid, in its canonical form (i.e., aligned with the coordinate axes and centered at the origin), is given by `(x/a)^2 + (y/b)^2 + (z/c)^2 = 1`. However, in this case, the ellipsoid is rotated and translated, which needs to be accounted for.\n\n**Note**:\n1.

Also, the direction of the ray is a unit vector, and the coordinates of the center of the sphere and the ray's starting point are given in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nNote: Please do not use any built-in or third-party libraries to directly solve this problem. The focus is on understanding and applying the principles of ray-object intersection.\n\nFor your solution, please provide:\n\n1. The code of your function.\n2. A brief explanation of your approach and how your code works.\n3. Test your function with two examples: a ray that intersects the cut sphere and a ray that does not. Explain why your function returns the correct result in each case."
