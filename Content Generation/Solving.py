    "The object is an axis-aligned unit cube with one corner at (0, 0, 0), and the opposite corner at (1, 1, 1), i.e. extending 1 unit on each axis.",
    "The object is a square with the corners (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), and (0, 1, 0) in counterclockwise order.",
    "The object is a cylinder. The base of the cylinder is a circle with center (0, 0, 0) and radius 1. The cylinder aligns with the y-axis, and it has height 1 towards the positive y-axis, which means that the top of the cylinder is centered at (0, 1, 0) with radius 1.",
    "The object is a combination of two spheres fused together. The first sphere is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius 1. The second sphere is centered (1, 0, 0) with radius 1.",
    "The object is a disc (2D circle in 3D space). The disc is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius 1, and its normal is (1, 1, 1).",
    "The object is a quad with a circular hole. The quad is a trapezoid with the corners (1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1), (-2, -1, -2), and (2, -1, 2) in counterclockwise order. The circular hole is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius 1. Light can pass through the circular hole but not the quad.",
    "The object is a plane with a triangular hole. The plane is y = z. The triangular hole has corners (1, 1, 1), (-1, 0, 0), and (0, -1, -1) in counterclockwise order. Light can pass through the triangular hole but not the plane.",
    "The object is an axis-aligned ellipsoid centered at (1, 1, 1). The length of its x, y, z semi-axes are 2, 3, 4 respectively. This object can be represented using the equation (x-1)^2/(2)^2 + (y-1)^2/(3)^2 + (z-1)^2/(4)^2 = 1",
    "The object is a sphere cut by a plane. The sphere is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius 1. The plane is x + y = 1. The smaller portion of the sphere is removed. The sphere is solid, hence the intersections between the ray and the cross-section at the cut need to be considered.",
    "The object is a solid sphere centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius 1, with a portion of it removed. The removed portion is the intersection between the original sphere and another sphere centered at (0.5, 0.5, 0) with radius 1.",
    "The object is a solid sphere centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius 1, with a portion of it removed. The removed portion is the intersection between the original sphere and a cylinder centered at (0, 0, 0) parallel to the x axis with radius 0.7 and infinite width (from x = -inf to x = inf).",
